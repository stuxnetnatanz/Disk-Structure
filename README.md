Simulating UNIX/Linux file system
This a program to create hierarchical file system simulation written in c++

It creates a virtual disk on your system of specified size and lets you perform the following operations:

create/ read/ delete/ recover/ remove a file
create a directory
switch between different directories
list files
Download and run
$ git clone https://github.com/stuxnetnatanz/Disk-structure.git
$ g++ disk.cpp
$ ./a.out
Working
Approach
All read and write operations are done sector by sector. Some sectors are reserved for storing status of other sectors. As soon as user creates a new directory, 2 sectors are reserved for it. Entry for any dir/file is of 32 bytes. Whenever changes are made to any sector, its status is changed simultaneously.

Calculations
Default sector size is set to 512 bytes (can be changed but calculations change accordingly).

Example:
Size of the disk(in mb) = 1
Size of the disk(in bytes) = size_in_mb * ( 2 ^ 20 ) = 2 ^ 20
Size of each sector = 2 ^ 9
Total no. of sectors = size of disk(in bytes) / sector_size = ( 2 ^ 20 ) / ( 2 ^ 9 ) = 2 ^ 11
Status is of 4 bytes
Each sector contains status of ( 2 ^ 7 ) sectors
Reserved sectors = Total_no_of_sectors / ( 2 ^ 7 ) = 2 ^ 4
2 Sectors are reserved for root directory (Sector no: reserved sectors and reserved sectors+1)
File operations:
Create
Read
Delete
Recover
Remove
Directory operations:
Access parent directory
Move to root directory
Change current directory
